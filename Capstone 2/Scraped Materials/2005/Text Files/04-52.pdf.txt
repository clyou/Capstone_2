CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well hear argument 

(11:04 a.m.) 

next in Rice v. Collins. 

General Lockyer. 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM W. LOCKYER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. LOCKYER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

This Court has repeatedly communicated an 
understanding of the appropriate deference owed to 
State court fact finding in habeas review under 28 
U.S.C., section 2254.  Here, we dont have a simple 
case of the Ninth Circuit applying the proper standard 
of deference, but getting the wrong result.  The 
problem is the Ninth Circuit doesnt get the standard. 
Although --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just at the -- at the 

outset -- and Im -- Im not sure youre prepared for 
this, but the joint appendix, volume 2, is under seal, right? 

MR. LOCKYER:  Yes. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In the course of the 

argument, I think wed be very interested in knowing 
about the colloquy that the trial judge had with the 
attorneys, and if its under seal, its a little bit

awkward to do that.  Is there any reason that it has to 
be kept under seal? 

MR. LOCKYER:  None -- none at all, Justice 

Kennedy.  I believe we provided the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I take it --
MR. LOCKYER:  -- appendix 2 --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- I take it that the --

the names of the jurors we dont know because theyre 
given numbers. 

MR. LOCKYER:  Thats correct. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So far as you know, the 

counsel for the respondent would also have no 
objection? 

MR. LOCKYER:  Neither of us have any 
objection, and its been quoted extensively --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes, it was then quoted 

extensively in the Ninth Circuit I thought. 

MR. LOCKYER:  In -- in the briefs as well. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Thank you. 
MR. LOCKYER:  Thank you, Mr. Kennedy --

Justice Kennedy. 

In this instance, the Ninth Circuit professes 

fealty to AEDPA deference, but it seems simply too 
easy, having sensed a constitutional injury, to become 
willing to attribute error to the State court and to

substitute its own factual inferences for those of the 
trial judge. 

The way the Court decides this case can 

provide further instruction to habeas courts to help 
them avoid the Ninth Circuit error.  Id suggest at 
least four instructions that might be considered. 

First, confirming that the objective 

reasonableness test, that inquiry under (d)(2), is like 
that currently under (d)(1).  That is, the factual 
inquiry, like that under the legal inquiry, more 
deferential than review for clear error. 

Second, since it seems logical that State 

fact finding should be entitled to equal, if not 
greater, respect than that now accorded State court 
resolution of legal issues under (d)(1), weve argued 
for adoption of the Jackson v. Virginia kind of 
standard as consistent with the letter and spirit of 
AEDPA, meaning that witness credibility determinations 
rarely may be overturned, and that all of the evidence 
must be reviewed in the light most favorable to the 
factfinder. 

Third, although Miller-El v. Dretke 
represented an extraordinarily egregious and I 
personally think undeniable violation of Batson, some 
might react to a whiff of a little smoke as a Miller-El 

5

fire.  Proper resolution of this case can make it clear 
that Miller-El v. Dretke dealt with a outlier and that 
the traditional line of this Courts habeas cases, 
restricting Federal courts from second-guessing a State 
judges credibility calls, retain their vitality. 

Finally and specifically responding to Mr. 

Collins argument that this case, it seems, is an 
opportunity to confirm the well-established presumption 
of correctness for State court fact finding under 
section 2254(e)(1), that it remains available in all 
habeas cases.  Collins view that the traditional 
presumption now applies only in the rare case of 
Federal evidentiary hearings would eviscerate the 
traditional presumption.  In my office --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it is -- it is 
a little unusual to have under your view two different 
sections, both addressed to the question of the 
appropriate standard of review in a particular type of 
proceeding.  They seem either redundant or overlapping. 
The theory on the other side at least distinguishes 
them and argues that they apply in different 
circumstances. 

MR. LOCKYER:  Thats true, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Our view is that the (e)(1) test really focuses on 
specific facts that have been found in State court.

The (d)(2) focus is on the decision, which presumably 
would be a bundle of multiple facts, the decision of 
the court and whether it was objectively unreasonable. 
And to limit the (e)(1) presumption not only, 
I think, being contrary to congressional intention when 
AEDPA reforms were adopted, and your cases that have 
applied both (e)(1) and (d)(2) as separate, independent 
tests -- in my office, there are 320 attorneys that do 
Federal habeas work, 120,000 hours of lawyering.  If 
you take out the capital cases, the non-capital Federal 
habeas claims, only 2 or 3 percent ever go to a Federal 
evidentiary hearing.  So the result of reading that 
(e)(1) without the presumption in the cold record case 
means basically the State loses the presumption for 
almost every habeas claim that we look at.  So it would 
seem to not be also supported by the statutes clear 
terms.  Theres no limitation written into (e)(1) that 
it -- its -- doesnt apply across the board to all 
habeas claims. 
The --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about the 
contention in the particular proceeding that the 
district court -- or the State fact finder did not, in 
fact, make a determination, but simply gave the benefit 
of the doubt to the prosecutor?

 MR. LOCKYER:  Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I think 

that reading the transcript will show that the judge, 
hearing the Batson motion, asking counsel to explain 
the reasons for her strikes, allowing defense counsel 
to comment and explain, and then the ruling of the 
judge seems to be a general one, both contemplating 
both demeanor and youthfulness, and benefit of the 
doubt may refer back to the fact that theres a dispute 
about the challenged juror and whether she turned 
aside, rolled her eyes in a dismissive and 
disrespectful way.  And the judge says, well, I didnt 
see that behavior, but Ill give you the benefit of the 
doubt.  But I think the ruling is a general one that 
subsumes both claims, youthfulness and demeanor. 

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, I thought youthfulness 

-- 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I -- I noticed the 

defense attorney, respondent here, did not comment in 
any way on the -- the demeanor of the -- of witness 16, 
which means either the -- he -- he saw it and said 
nothing or he -- he didnt see it at all.  We dont 
know. 

MR. LOCKYER:  Justice Kennedy, thats 

correct.  There was no comment. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- what is the

obligation that we impose on the prosecution in this 
case to give a coherent explanation of why there -- the 
juror was excused?  That step has proceeded.  Were at 
that step in Batson where an explanation has to be 
given.  What -- what have we said about how coherent 
and complete that explanation has to be? 

MR. LOCKYER:  Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Here, it seems that the 

prosecutor was somewhat caught off guard or -- or 
certainly was not extremely clear. 

MR. LOCKYER:  Well, we are in the middle of a 

-- a trial, of course, and it happens quickly and, as 
the Court has suggested, often peremptory --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, Im not so sure 

quickly.  They gave notice that thered be a Batson 
hearing.  She should have known whats going on. 

MR. LOCKYER:  Yes, sir.  However, it was just 
a short time later in the day, Justice Kennedy.  There 
was a break to dismiss the jury and then come back to 
the Batson claim. 

But the peremptories, as the Court has 

frequently said, are intuitive, often inarticulable. 
In this case, I think the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the point is once 

theres a Batson challenge, it has to be articulated.

 MR. LOCKYER:  Well, I think that happens. 

That is, as soon as the prosecutor is asked to defend 
her challenge, she does, and she talks about 
youthfulness.  She says the young person doesnt have 
ties in the community, doesnt have a stake in the 
community, is unmarried, perhaps has a greater 
tolerance for drug crime with a small amount.  This is 
a three-strikes case.  It would be a natural worry, I 
think, for a district attorney to think that a third 
strike, even though one and two were armed robbery and 
rape -- that a third strike thats a possession of a 
small amount of drugs, you might need to worry about a 
jurors tolerance or worrying about that severity of 
sentence. 

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But -- but isnt -- isnt 

the difficulty with your analysis there, General, that, 
yes, she started out by -- by talking about 
youthfulness.  As I understand it, she started out talking 
about youthfulness and the -- and the demeanor, the 
rolling of the eyes. 

MR. LOCKYER:  Yes. 
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Sort of at the second stage, 

again she spoke of youthfulness.  Then at a third 
stage, she said, well, its a combination of -- of age, 
gender, and inexperience.  Then she realized she was in

trouble, and she said, well, I really didnt mean 
gender because I -- Id be in constitutional hot water 
there.  Then she said, well, I really dont mean age 
because there are other young people on the jury, and 
Im -- Im not challenging them.  So that the only 
thing that was left was possibly that element of age 
which refers to ties to the community. 

And at the end of this long colloquy, in 

which she has gone back and forth and back and forth 
and -- and jettisoned some of her reasons, the trial 
judge says, well, I didnt see the eye-rolling, and I 
guess Ill give the benefit of the doubt to counsel.  I 
dont know whether the judge is talking about the 
benefit of the doubt on eye-rolling or the benefit of 
the doubt on -- on ties to the community. 

Assuming its ties to the community, that has 
nothing to do, I suppose, with -- with the -- the fear 
that a young person is going to be too sympathetic to a 
defendant whos up for the third time with a small 
amount of drugs. 

And at the end of the day, it seems to me we 
have what Justice Kennedys question in the first place 
suggested.  We simply have an incoherent colloquy and a 
response to the judge which simply does not tell you 
what the judge is ruling on or the basis for the

ruling.  All we know is that ultimately hes saying Im 
rejecting the Batson challenge.  Thats the problem 
with -- with deference in this case. 

What -- what is your response to that? 
MR. LOCKYER:  Well, thank you, Justice 

Souter.  First, Id point to the language that the 
judge provided, which was in regard to juror 16, the 
only one that is at issue, the court did not observe 
the demeanor.  However, 16 was a youthful person, as 
was 6, and then prepared to give the district attorney 
the benefit of the doubt. 

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but the district 

attorney has -- I mean, the -- the point here is were 
judging the district attorneys responses, not the 
judges responses. 

MR. LOCKYER:  Right. 
JUSTICE SOUTER:  What we want to know is what 
the judge found and ruled upon.  The district attorney, 
as I understand it, has withdrawn the general claim 
that youthfulness is a problem, and the only claim that 
might have been -- might -- probably was comprehended 
under youth that -- that remains is the claim of no 
community ties.  And I find it very difficult to tell 
from the judges ruling whether the judge is saying, 
yes, I think theres a fair showing that there are no

community ties and thats certainly a race-neutral 
reason.  I dont know what the judge was -- was --

MR. LOCKYER:  If I may, Justice Souter.  The 

DA never withdrew the youthful claim. 

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, didnt the DA say, 

look, youth alone doesnt -- doesnt explain my reasons 
because there are other young people on the jury that 
-- that were not challenging, and -- and I dont want 
to suggest that all young people should be 
disqualified? 

MR. LOCKYER:  Right. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  General, does -- does the 

judge have to find what the reason for the strike was, 
or does the judge have to find what the reason for the 
strike wasnt? 

MR. LOCKYER:  The judge has to find that it 

was not a racially discriminatory strike. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if there are several 

allegations and -- and each of them is somewhat 
doubtful but, on balance, he says, I give the benefit 
of the -- of the doubt to the -- to the district 
attorney, its his indication that, as a matter of 
fact, he finds that the reason wasnt race. 

MR. LOCKYER:  Justice Scalia, your direct --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this question,

General? 

MR. LOCKYER:  Yes. 
JUSTICE STEVENS:  There are really two kinds 
of Batson problems as I see it.  There are some cases 
where the prosecutor is -- just is deliberately keeping 
African Americans off the jury, and there -- theres no 
question theres a violation there. 

But Im wondering if there isnt another 
category where persons are unconscious of their own 
subconscious bias and not realizing that they 
themselves have an unconscious fear that perhaps an 
African American might not be a sympathetic juror. 
Would that kind of failure to really identify the 
problem within the prosecutors own conception of the 
case -- would that be a Batson violation in your view? 
MR. LOCKYER:  Well, probably not, because the 

requirement is that the strike be intentionally done. 
That is, theres an intentionality.  If its 
unconscious, as you suggest, Justice Stevens, I -- I 
would think that wouldnt qualify. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  If, for example, the judge 
saw that over a period of time, a particular prosecutor 
had hunches about jurors over and over again and they 
just happened to be black most of the time.  That would 
not justify a -- a Batson challenge.

 MR. LOCKYER:  Well, there might be a pattern 

over time. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But -- but shes totally 

convinced of the good faith of the prosecutor.  And Im 
not suggesting bad faith. 

MR. LOCKYER:  Yes. 
JUSTICE STEVENS:  But just realizes this 

person has an unconscious bias that shows up in the --
in the pattern of challenges.  Would that be a 
justified challenge? 

MR. LOCKYER:  You might be able to deduce 

intent from -- infer it from a variety of challenges. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  You have to accept his 

hypothetical as he gave it.  Assuming that the 
attorney, the district attorney, was in good faith. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right. 
MR. LOCKYER:  In good faith? 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  Assuming that the --

the attorney did not think that he or she was striking 
the juror because of the jurors race. 

MR. LOCKYER:  Justice Stevens and Scalia, I 
would rely on the trial judge to make a determination 
of the intention of the district attorney --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  And if the trial judge 

determined --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the question is would 

he --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- based -- based on the 

history of several trials and so forth, that this 
prosecutor unconsciously had this hunch with respect to 
black jurors but not others, that would be a sufficient 
basis for a challenge. 

MR. LOCKYER:  Id be inclined to say yes. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there is no such --

that -- thats very far from this case, General 
Lockyer. 

MR. LOCKYER:  Yes. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I did -- I did have one --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That -- that gives a lot of 

power to district -- to -- to the district judge, 
doesnt it?  I mean, you know, this -- he says this --

brief that one some day, but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can we -- can we go back 

-- 

MR. LOCKYER:  -- but -- but its a good --
its a good question even though I -- I dont think 
its whats happening in this instance.  And I mostly 
would say we rely on the trial judge whos there --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Except in this very case, 
one gets the impression that the prosecutor was pretty 
confused, but maybe she was acting in good faith. 

MR. LOCKYER:  I -- I believe thats correct 

from the record. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  She was certainly -- she 
was certainly wrong on the law.  When she -- when the 
gender question came up, she said, well, that's not a 
suspect category, and she seemed to be -- her notion 
was that it was okay to aim for a jury that had an 
equal number of men and women.  And it was -- she 
seemed to be thinking the same thing with regard to age 
too.  I agree with you she didnt withdraw it, but was 
-- the reasonable explanation was we dont want too 
many young people here.  So Im going to allow some, 
but I want older people to dominate.  But the gender --
she had to be told by the judge Batson applies to 
gender.  That -- that seemed -- that seemed strange to

me that -- that 2 years after, she would not know. 

MR. LOCKYER:  Justice Ginsburg, I think that 

perhaps an explanation -- and, again, if the trial 
judge thought it was reasonable -- is there some 
compelling reason to read it a different way years 
later on appeal after the California Court of Appeal, a 
Federal magistrate, and a Federal district judge have 
agreed with the trial judges perspectives. 

But it could be that she is quoting, as 

youll see in the transcript, California law that had 
talked about jury balances.  Its good to have young 
and old.  Its good to have different races. 

I agree.  Youre absolutely right.  J.E.B. v. 
Alabama had occurred a couple of years before, and the 
judge does say, I dont see, Ms. Satriano, that you are 
seeking to justify excusing people of one ethnicity 
based on gender.  So he seemed to at least be saying, 
you started with youth.  Everything you said about 
youth, ties in the community, tolerance for drug use, 
unmarried, which might be distinctions with other young 
people -- those -- do you have anything else to say? 
And I -- I suspect she felt like compelled to come up 
with some further explanation. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What -- what is the -- where 

-- where is the place in what the judge -- when did

this eye-rolling take place?  I cant figure it out. 

MR. LOCKYER:  Okay.  Yes.  During the 

judicial voir dire. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, I have that in front of 

me. 

MR. LOCKYER:  And --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What was the statement that 

the judge made in respect to which the juror is 
supposed to have rolled her eyes? 

MR. LOCKYER:  The district attorney simply 

says with one of the questions to which you -- the 
prospective --

JUSTICE BREYER: 	 Which question? 
MR. LOCKYER:  Its unclear. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  So the reason I cant find 

it out is none of us know. 

MR. LOCKYER:  No, youre right.  I mean, its 
one where -- it doesnt say in the record eye-rolling. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And it actually says it 

wasnt a question.  It was a statement, and thats why 
I cant figure it out. 

MR. LOCKYER:  It -- it seems to be where the 
juror said yes in response to the voir dire, and then 
--  

JUSTICE BREYER: 	 Which was a question you

said --

MR. LOCKYER:  -- turned aside.  All we know 
is yes was said.  We dont know what the question was. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I see. 
MR. LOCKYER:  The -- a point I guess to be 

made about this confusing transcript -- and of course, 
I dont know what the file looked like with respect to 
Miller-El, but this is it.  Obviously, theres not a 
lot to go on, and I think it suggests how vital it is 
to rely on the trial court judge to make some 
credibility determination.  Hes there and sees the 
district attorney and tries to, after making 
appropriate inquiries, say that he accepts her non(cid:173)
racial reasons. 

Counsel for respondent does a lot to compare 

to Miller-El and so perhaps its worth just 
distinguishing briefly.  There we have 10 of 11 African 
American jurors struck.  We have the lawyers doing the 
questioning, trick questions, loaded questions, 
complicated questions.  We have the external evidence 
of the Dallas manual recommending discriminatory 
strikes.  We have the cards with race written on them. 

Here, we have a very brief, quick proceeding. 
The judge is asking the questions and really resisting

lawyers attempts to add to that, to get more 
information so you can make a valid assessment of the 
juror thats before you.  And so in this instance, 
obviously, relying on intuition, trial experience, she 
exercises the two peremptory challenges, one of which 
was withdrawn on appeal and not pursued, the other with 
respect to the young person, the demeanor, and 
youthfulness are the grounds given. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask just a -- kind of 
a background question?  I noticed the judge pointed out 
after ruling that he was under -- he -- I cant 
remember if it was a he or a she, but was under an 
obligation to report its reasons for granting Wheeler 
motion to the State bar. 

MR. LOCKYER:  Yes. 
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Does that -- did that 

requirement apply after the Ninth Circuit decision?  Is 
there a requirement that the -- the lawyer be 
investigated for possible discipline? 

MR. LOCKYER:  We tried to research it, 

Justice Stevens, and we believe that it was a -- a 
State court rule adopted subsequent to Wheeler.  And 
that -- of course, unlike the way in which it is 
characterized in respondents briefs, it wasnt a 
warning to her, the district attorney, that is.  It was

a general statement.  If theres a Batson claim, Im 
obligated to report. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I -- I read it as 
saying, and therefore Im going to be careful about 
finding that theres been a Batson violation.  And I 
wonder if thats consistent with what we want trial 
judges to do when theyre hearing Batson challenges. 

MR. LOCKYEAR:  Justice Kennedy, I 

frankly didnt read it that way.  It just seemed to be 
he was stating the fact, that it would be an obligation 
to report.  Clearly, it has some impact on how people 
feel about the judicial system and the particular 
lawyers reputation if the judge were to affirm the 
motion.  But I -- I would expect the judge was doing 
his job and performing his duties correctly. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  If you have a minute, you 

might -- I dont know if you -- if this is very useful. 
But Ive taken this point of view that -- that theres 
no way to get to the bottom of the use of stereotypes 
in cases like this, a perfect example.  And therefore, 
the only thing to do, consistent with the Constitution, 
is no peremptories. 

MR. LOCKYER:  Well, I know thats your view, 

Justice Breyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You have 30 seconds.  You

want to say how irresponsible that is, right? 

MR. LOCKYER:  I prefer to keep the tradition 

and allow the peremptory challenges. 

Thank you.  Ill reserve time, if I may. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General. 
Mr. Drozdowski, well hear now from you. 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. DROZDOWSKI 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

The Ninth Circuit properly held that the 

State appellate court decision represented an 
unreasonable determination of facts because the 
prosecutor did not give a single persuasive reason for 
striking juror 16. 

The circuit also rightly held that the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why isnt the rolling 

of the eyes a persuasive reason? 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Well, here the rolling of 

the eyes, first, is uncorroborated by the trial judge. 
He says, quite frankly, I did not see it.  And in his 
ruling, he does not credit that rationale. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, what -- what should 

happen if the trial judge doesnt see it and a counsel, 
whos observant, said, judge, Ive got a problem with

this juror?  I dont know that the trial judge has to 
-- has to see it, if he believes the counsel. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  That could be, but here the 

trial courts --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Weve -- weve all been --

been in court and -- and noticed that sometimes 
witnesses or jurors or parties or even attorneys will 
make faces and so forth thats not consistent with --
with proper demeanor in a courtroom. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Thats correct.  But whats 

significant here is that this was a judge-conducted 
voir dire where juror 16 would have been facing the 
judge when giving her answer.  So the judge would have 
been in the best position to see the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So youre --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Maybe the judge is reading. 
A judge doesnt watch -- watch the witness 100 percent 
of the time.  Thats not credible. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  As the Court has previously 

mentioned, what we also have here is theres no --
theres no corroboration in the transcript that juror 
-- 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So what is the point?  The 
judge says, Ill give the prosecution the benefit of 
the doubt.  Well, he -- he knows the prosecutor and he

believes the prosecutor.  I didnt see it, but Ill 
give him the benefit of the doubt.  He told me thats 
what she did.  Whats -- I mean, I really dont see why 
that isnt, given the present law, sufficient. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Well, here, the trial 

courts ruling -- he says, I did not see the demeanor 
complained of.  However, juror 16 is youthful, as are 
other jurors.  Im prepared to give the district 
attorney the benefit of the doubt.  So I think the 
ruling here, if there is, indeed, a finding of no 
discrimination, would be limited to the youth rationale 
clearly by --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why? 
JUSTICE BREYER:  You mean benefit of the 

doubt just refers to youth.  I -- I read that as 
referring to the whole story. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I -- its pretty 

hard to read that as saying, Ill give him the benefit 
of the doubt in respect to the youth.  It sounds as if 
Ill give him the benefit of the doubt in respect to 
the reasons he gave for challenging her.  There are two 
other African American jurors on the jury.  She is 
useful -- youthful.  He -- she saw him -- he saw her 
rolling her eyes when -- what do you think about the

drugs or some other relevant question.  And he says, 
Ill give him the benefit of the doubt.  I mean, I 
dont see how to read that in a way that -- that comes 
out the way you want it to come out. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Well -- well, even --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So tell me. 
MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Okay.  Even if the Court 

concludes that the trial judge did credit the demeanor 
rationale, its still a wholly unpersuasive reason to 
give in light of everything else the prosecutor did 
here.  The demeanor rationale wasnt the sole reason 
given.  It comes as part of a litany of reasons that 
are all either unconstitutional, the gender rationale, 
or contradicted or unsupported by the record. 

And there was some discussion earlier about 

this.  Miller-El makes clear that the district attorney 
must give the real reason for the strike, not just any 
rational basis the prosecutor can think up.  And when 
we look at the transcript of the Batson hearing here, 
we see a prosecutor scrambling to think of anything she 
-- 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, isnt this just 

another way of saying you dont believe the proffered 
justification?  In other words, the -- the trial judge 
made a credibility determination that that was the

reason, the person rolled her eyes, and youre saying, 
in light of the other explanations, you think the 
prosecutor is just making that up. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  I -- I think two things.  I 
think, one, the reasonable conclusion is the prosecutor 
is making it up, but even if the Court -- the Court 
doesnt need to accept that to still come to the 
conclusion and say the demeanor rationale is still not 
the reason for the strike.  She cant say the reason 
here.  She comes up with six different reasons, but 
theyre all either --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So youre saying you 

dont believe it.  You think theres a different 
reason, and the rolling the eyes is not the real 
reason.  And we have a factual determination that the 
judge believes that thats the reason or a reason.  And 
under the -- the statute, at least that -- thats --
that either has to be shown to be unreasonable or, 
under the States reason, thats presumed to be 
correct, and you have to show it by clear and 
convincing evidence. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  And the Ninth Circuit 

properly found that the conclusion was both 
unreasonable and rebutted by clear and convincing 
evidence, and its because none of these reasons, when

we look at the totality -- what Im trying to say is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was the -- on the --

on the eye-roll, which I thought also the -- the 
prosecutor said that she turned her head.  So it may 
be that she was out of the vision of the -- the judge 
even if he had been looking.  I dont see that you have 
any evidence to rebut it.  You said, well, it was 
rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.  There was 
no evidence.  There was no evidentiary hearing. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Well, we cited a case on 

page 24 in our brief, a Third Circuit case, Riley, that 
says a reviewing courts suspicion may be raised by a 
series of very weak explanations given for the strike. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  There -- theres no doubt 

that the court -- or at least in my mind, that -- that 
the trial court could have come out the other way.  I 
-- I -- you know, all of the things you say are quite 
true.  The question is whether the trial court had to 
come out the other way, whether it was just utterly 
unreasonable for the trial court to come out the way it 
did.  And that -- you know, thats a -- thats a heavy 
burden.  And -- and it is a messy transcript and all of 
that, but I -- I find it difficult to see how -- how 
you can establish that -- not only that -- that the 
trial court could have come out the other way or,

indeed, maybe in your judgment, maybe in my judgment, 
should have come out the other way.  But you have to 
establish that its unreasonable not to come out the 
other way.  And -- and I find it hard to -- to see how 
you can do that when you have a transcript that relies, 
in part, upon the -- you know, the rolling of the eyes 
and the -- and the trial court says, Im -- Im willing 
to give her the benefit of the doubt that thats the 
reason she did it. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Well, Miller-El emphasizes 

that we need to view the prosecutors behavior 
cumulatively. And again, when we look at here the --
the prosecutor coming out with one reason after another 
to try to justify her strikes, consecutive strikes, of 
the only two black women on this jury, theres just 
simply no credibility left to give to the demeanor 
rationale even if one views that its --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought there was 

another -- another.  Wasnt there another minority 
woman on the -- in the jury panel? 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Juror 20 Collins explains --
Mr. -- trial counsel -- defense counsel, explained at 
the hearing was a person of color but not African 
American.  So the record shows, I believe, we have one 
African American on the jury and one other minority.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now -- now, number 19 was 

excused and was a black person. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Thats correct. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and a woman.  And if 

that too had been suspicious and challenged, then you 
might have had a pattern, a pattern of two people, 
which could have overcome the demeanor testimony --
demeanor claim. 

But I -- I think on this record that we have 
to assume that there is nothing wrongful about excusing 
juror 19 merely because respondents counsel here --
you did not pursue that.  I -- I read the record as --
as telling us that so far as juror 19 is concerned, 
there was an adequate reason for excusing that juror. 
At least respondents counsel -- you have not said that 
there wasnt. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Well, on the State appeal, 

its true that Collins attorney dropped the claim 
specifically as to juror 19.  But the reason the 
prosecutors strike of juror 19 is relevant is at step 
three of Batson, this Court has emphasized that the 
duty of the trial judge to determine purposeful 
discrimination requires an examination of all the 
relevant circumstances. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So what is the remedy -- the

remedy if we say and hold with you that prosecutors 
cant give reasons like they gave here?  How is a --
whats a prosecutor supposed to do?  I mean, the 
prosecutor might be moved by stereotype.  Young African 
American women -- of course, she tolerates drugs. 
Well, not quite of course.  Well -- well -- well, she 
rolled her eyes.  Well, at least she looked in this 
direction.  Well, I sort of -- maybe Im seeing eye-
rolling here.  I mean, we all understand that.  But 
thats why I guess I am where I am.  I -- I dont see 
what the -- I dont see what were telling prosecutors 
if we hold in your favor, and I dont see how we deal 
with the problem if we hold against you. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Well, I -- I think -- I 

think the record here reinforces Your Honors view on 
-- 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But Im asking for your 

experience.  You have a lot of experience as a defense 
lawyer.  How is this thing supposed to work? 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Well, I -- I think if -- if 
the Court allows to happen what -- what happened here, 
then I think the message it could be saying to 
prosecutors, is as long as you can just rifle off a 
series of -- of reasons for your strike and then the 
trial court latches onto one of them, taking it out of

the context of the plausibility of all the other 
strikes, then were going to allow this type of behavior 
to continue. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  This prosecutor presumably 

appears before this judge on other occasions, and --
and dont you think we -- we can give some weight to 
the fact that the judge is there, sees the woman, sees 
what shes saying, and -- and can judge better than we 
can whether shes making this up or just -- just is --
is somewhat confused, especially since, as -- as I 
think the General pointed out, were dealing with a 
kind of determination that is usually instinctive on 
the part of trial counsel.  Theres just something 
about this, you know, and you move to strike.  Im not 
sure it springs into your mind, at the time you -- you 
move to strike, the precise reason.  Then somebody asks 
you later, why was it?  Why was it?  There was just 
something about that person I didnt like.  I know it 
wasnt the race.  That had nothing to do with it.  Now, 
what was it?  And then -- then you have to recreate a 
-- a rational process that, in fact, never occurred. 
It was an instinctive process more than a rational one. 
So Im -- Im not particularly upset by -- by 

seeing counsel flounder about in -- in trying to come 
up with what the right reason was.  I think its

probably pretty hard to figure out. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  First of all, theres 

nothing in the record to indicate that this prosecutor 
had appeared many times before this trial judge. 

Another point is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, she might in the 
future, if shes got a job as a prosecutor in this 
court.  So shes certainly going to be concerned with 
her reputation, her integrity before the court. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Thats right, but I guess 

what Im trying to say is its not that the judge said, 
you know, Ms. Prosecutor, youve appeared before me 
many times and Im willing to give you the benefit of 
the doubt because I know the way you are.  We have 
nothing like that here. 

Also, as far as it being instinctive, Batson 

and Miller-El require the prosecutor to give the 
reasons and stand and fall on the plausibility of those 
reasons.  And -- and here --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Im saying that its hard. 

Thats all.  And -- and that you can understand why 
somebody would flop around because, at the time the 
strike is made, Im -- Im not sure its always an 
entirely rational rather than instinctive action. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  I understand, but whats

significant here is when she is flopping around, the 
reason she comes up with -- she says gender.  Its 
patently unconstitutional and discriminatory.  We have 
youth, and then she says, well, its not that theyre 
younger.  Other young people on the jury.  Its not 
that I dont want young people.  And she doesnt strike 
juror 15. 

JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right.  Let me -- let me 
ask you as a -- as a response to -- to the kind of the 
incoherent flopping around argument, let me ask you 
what your position would be if the record were 
different in the following respect. 

Lets assume the record is just what it is up 

until that final paragraph or so in which the judge 
rules.  And instead of doing what he did in this case, 
the judge says the following two things.  He says, 
number one, I didnt see the eye-rolling, but I accept 
counsels representation of fact that the eye-rolling 
went on and I certainly understand the -- the 
significance of that.  So Im going to take that as a 
fact. 

Number two, even though counsel has withdrawn 

the -- the sort of the general claim of youth and so 
on, I understand counsel still to be saying this is a 
person without any manifest ties to the community and

-- and that suggests a certain looseness of 
responsibility. 

And based upon the eye-rolling and based upon 
the lack of ties to the community, I think counsel had 
a race-neutral basis for the -- for the strike that was 
made, and for that reason, Im going to overrule the 
Batson challenge with respect to number 16. 

What would your position be? 
MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Well, that -- that would be 

a -- a tougher case for us because we would have an 
explicit ruling --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Right. 
MR. DROZDOWSKI:  -- of what actually 

happened. 

JUSTICE SOUTER:  What would your position be? 
MR. DROZDOWSKI:  I still think that in this 

case, given the entire context and all the other 
reasons given, including the gender reason, that it 
would still -- that those demeanor and youth reasons 
would still not be persuasive looking at the context --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  So you would say that those 

two conclusions on the part of the court were 
unreasonable? 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  On -- on this record, yes, 

given all the other reasons we have given by the

prosecutor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you would say 

youve established that by clear and convincing 
evidence? 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  I would because when we go 
through the comparative juror analysis and look at the 
record of the whole, we see that the reasons given, for 
example, on youth are not used for similarly situated 
white jurors. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but number 6 was a 

young white -- young white male, I believe, and he was 
excused on the ground of youth.  So its consistent. 
MR. DROZDOWSKI:  6 was different in that he 
was unemployed, in fact, had never been employed, and 
also he had an uncle who was a recovered alcoholic, and 
that made him quite different from juror 16. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Whats wrong with the 

explanation, as far as youth is concerned, is that she 
didnt want to across-the-board strike young people, 
but she just wanted to come up with a jury that had 
dominantly older people.  So that wouldnt mean that 
shes withdrawing youth.  Its just that shes saying 
it isnt an absolute with me. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Well, I think shes also 
admitting that youth wasnt a reason because shes

saying there are other young people on the jury, and 
the significant question here --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, whats -- one -- one 

point could be I dont want too many young people, so 
Im going to exercise some peremptories to make sure 
that the jury is dominantly older people.  Whats wrong 
with that? 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Whats wrong with that here 

is the question is why is she using that rationale 
against the young black juror and not the -- the young 
white jurors on the panel?  How come shes seeking to 
achieve the balance by striking juror 16? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, she did.  Number 6 

was white.  Right? 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Correct. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And youth was a factor 
there.  There may have been other factors, but youth 
was certainly a factor in that case. 

JUSTICE SOUTER:  And this one rolled her 

eyes. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Right, but when we look at 
the totality of the reasons, which include looking at 
the way she treated juror 19, we have the lack of ties 
in the community --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Juror 19 -- you just

said earlier the fact that the one jurors uncle had an 
alcohol problem was -- was a legitimate factor.  Juror 
19s daughter had a -- a cocaine problem and this was a 
cocaine case.  Isnt that a perfectly legitimate reason 
for exercising a peremptory with respect to a juror? 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  The significance of the 
treatment of juror 19 is, right out of the box, the 
prosecutor is coming up with reasons that she says 
apply to both 16 and 19, the only two black women on 
the jury.  And these are very disparate women, and 
theyre different in age and occupation status, the 
number of children they have, and people they -- who 
are close to them who have substance abuse problems. 
And right out of the box, the prosecutor is saying that 
both of them are disqualified from jury service because 
theyre both young, when juror 19, in fact, was a 
retired grandmother. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that -- that was so 
obviously a slip, and Judge Hall pointed that out in 
her dissent.  Defense counsel too confused -- was 
confused on the numbers.  Obviously, it -- the -- the 
prosecutor wasnt trying to say a grandmother is going 
to be excused -- is going to be struck because shes 
young. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  I respectfully disagree that

it was a mistake.  Her answer -- her response that 
juror 16 and 19 are both young came immediately in 
response to the courts request that the prosecutor 
justify her peremptory strikes of judge 16 -- jurors 16 
and 19. 

And then later on, when the judge said that 
gender was not going to cut it, the prosecutor said, 
well, its not really gender.  She backtracked to 
youth, and she said what is important, their youth is 
important.  And she could only have been referring to 
16 and 19 at that point because there was no claim that 
juror 6 was being excluded because of his gender. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would you say the same 

thing about the defense counsel confusing jurors 16 and 
19 on page 9?  The bottom of page 9, it seems to me Ms. 
-- Ms. Nachman is confusing juror 19 with 16.  Theyre 
talking about 16 and 6, and then Ms. Nachman ends by 
talking about juror 19.  That seems to me clearly to 
mean number 16. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Well, Im -- I -- I dont 

think so because on the next page she continues 
discussing juror 19 at the top of page 10. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I -- I dont think 

its a necessary reading. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maybe Im -- what --

what is the inference you try to draw from the 
treatment of juror 19?  That the prosecutor wants to --
was striking people on the basis of their race or that 
she had better reasons for 19 than 16? 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  No, no.  The conclusion is 
that she was striking jurors on the basis of the race, 
that she is using --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And then what do you 
do with the fact that juror 19s daughter had a cocaine 
problem and this was a cocaine case?  That doesnt seem 
to be -- thats not a race-based reason.  Thats seems 
to me to be a good reason. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Right.  Were not 

challenging the strike of 19 per se.  What were saying 
is that the prosecutors reasons she gave for 19 are 
important in trying to determine whether she is 
intentionally discriminating in striking juror 16.  And 
the fact that she is lumping the two jurors together, 
not treating them as individuals, but treating them, in 
fact, stereotypically by saying that all -- that three 
of these reasons apply to both of them, when the record 
clearly shows that they dont apply to juror 19, it 
shows -- it shows the discriminatory behavior. 

The -- the Attorney General said that this 

case is unlike Miller-El, but Id just like to

emphasize certainly here we have a petitioner who was 
representing himself pro se and he did not present 
extra-record evidence of a -- of a history of 
discrimination. 

But the case-specific evidence is similar to 
Miller-El in important respects, and Miller-El requires 
relief in this case. 

First -- first of all, three of the reasons 
given here for the strikes pertain just as well to non-
black jurors as to the black jurors, and thats youth, 
tolerance, and single. 

Here, as in Miller-El, we have the district 
attorney scrambling from rationale to rationale and, 
when called on, one of the reasons shifting to another. 

And here, the district attorney did not ask 
questions on grounds later used to justify the strike. 
Now, clearly here, its a judge-conducted voir dire, 
but the attorneys were allowed to ask the judge to ask 
different questions -- to ask that the judge ask 
additional questions.  And here, at the conclusion of 
the voir dire of jurors 1 through 17, the -- the 
prosecutor asked the judge to ask four additional 
questions.  Three of them were to the panel generally 
and one specifically about juror 8.  But the prosecutor 
never asked that any additional questions be asked of

juror 16 before she struck her. 

If I could turn briefly to the States 
Jackson v. Virginia argument, unless theres any 
additional questions on the Batson claim.  The States 
claim that (d)(2) and (e)(1) incorporate the Jackson 
sufficiency of the evidence test is contrary to the 
plain terms of (d)(2) and (e)(1) and this Courts cases 
construing those provisions.  And the State still 
hasnt cited a single case prescribing a Jackson type 
of review, and courts have been construing AEDPA for 
over 9 years now.  That should be the end of the line 
for the States argument. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What do you do with 

the argument that your reading of the two sections 
means that (e)(1) would only apply in a very small 
number of cases, and its obvious that Congress was 
trying to tighten the habeas review procedures? 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Our argument is based on the 
-- the structure and text of the statute and -- and the 
fact that the clear and convincing requirement is tied 
to the presumption of correctness. 

Id like to emphasize that the Ninth Circuit 
in this case did apply both (d)(2) and (e)(1), as this 
Court did in Miller-El, and found that Collins has 
satisfied both standards.  So I just want to emphasize

for the Court, even if it does not agree with us on our 
construction of (e)(1), that relief is still 
appropriate in this case. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In -- in a sense, the 

standards perhaps ought to be reversed.  When you hear 
the evidence, which is what you do under (e)(1), that 
is when youve determined -- should determine whether 
its unreasonable.  You should presume that its 
correct before you decide whether youre going to hear. 
So you could argue that they should be --

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Right.  I -- I think our 

argument is based on the fact that we have the 
presumption of correctness as part of (e), which is the 
fact development procedure in Federal court. 

The States Jackson argument, Id just like 
to highlight, is irreconcilable with what this Court 
said in Miller-El I, and what it did in Miller-El II. 
In Miller-El I, this Court stated that Federal courts 
can disagree with State court credibility 
determinations and, when guided by AEDPA, determine 
that the conclusion is unreasonable or its factual 
premise rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. 

In Miller-El II, this Court disagreed with 
the State court credibility determination and granted 
habeas relief even though the significance of some of

the habeas petitioners evidence was open to judgment 
calls. 

By contrast, this Court stated in Schlup v. 
Delo, that the assessment of credibility is generally 
beyond the scope of review in Jackson. 

And in the Crenshaw case cited by the State, 

the Court explained that under Jackson, the test for 
rejecting evidence as incredible is extraordinarily 
stringent and is met, for example, only when the 
testimony given is describing facts that are physically 
impossible. 

This Court couldnt have granted relief in 

Miller-El if it construed (d)(2) or (e)(1) as 
containing the Jackson test, and the States approach 
would effectively bar habeas relief whenever a habeas 
petitioner challenged a credibility determination. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you think that (d)(2) or 

(e)(1) is the -- is the stricter requirement?  Im 
really not sure which of the two.  Dont you think it 
-- it might be possible to show, by clear and 
convincing evidence, that the State court decision was 
-- factual decision was wrong, but you, nonetheless, do 
not show that it was unreasonable?  In other words, it 
may well be that (d)(2) is -- is the more severe one. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  I -- I think theyre

different standards.  (e)(1) is a -- a standard of 
proof, and (d)(2) is a standard of assessing a prior 
courts assessment of the facts. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If -- if I might ask.  You 
have no objection to our unsealing the joint appendix, 
volume 2. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  No, we dont. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Thank you. 
MR. DROZDOWSKI:  If I could briefly sum up. 
In Powers v. Ohio, this Court said that the Fourteenth 
Amendment mandate, that racial discrimination be 
eliminated from all acts and proceedings of the State, 
is most compelling in the judicial system. 

Here, the district attorney struck two of 
three African American jurors, including both black 
women, where a black defendant was facing a sentence of 
25 years to life in a three-strikes case for possessing 
.1 grams of cocaine. 

One of the reasons given by the district 

attorney is patently unconstitutional:  gender.  And 
all the other reasons are either contradicted or 
unsupported by the record. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do you, by any means -- you 

dont contend, though, the fact that she did rely, in 
part, on an unconstitutional reason is a sufficient

reason for sustaining a Batson type challenge? 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  In this case, its very 
significant that she relied on the unconstitutional 
reason. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But you have not argued 
that that would be a sufficient reason for setting 
aside the verdict. 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  This claim was not raised in 

State court as a gender challenge as opposed to race, 
if Im answering the Courts question. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do you think it would have 

had merit if you had made that argument? 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  Absolutely, and I think it 

has merit here because its -- its a reason the 
district attorney admitted that was motivating her 
strike.  Its -- its patently unconstitutional and it 
taints every other reason she gave. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Counsel, is there anything 

in the record to alert us to the race of the 
prosecutor? 

MR. DROZDOWSKI:  There is not besides her 

name. 

JUSTICE THOMAS:  Would it make any 

difference?  There seemed to be some suggestion that 
there are stereotypes at play in these Batson cases.

 MR. DROZDOWSKI:  No. 
Equal protection mandates relief in this 

case, and AEDPA does not prevent it. 

I respectfully request that the Court affirm 

the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.  Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
General Lockyer, you have 4 minutes 

remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM W. LOCKYER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. LOCKYER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
First, with respect to juror 19, I think its 

the best clear way to see what the Ninth Circuit did 
and what Collins continues to do, which is to 
substitute their reading, their inferences, and then 
conclude that anyone that disagrees is unreasonable. 

Juror 19 -- if you read page 5, its clearly 

a slip of the tongue where she accidentally is 
comparing the two young people, 6, and says 19. 
Immediately afterward, she says 6.  And the defense 
counsel says, well, who is 6?  She says, its the other 
young person, the young white person that I struck. 

That slip of the tongue is the heart of the 

Ninth Circuit effort and analysis to do, as the 
dissenters said in the en banc denial, nitpick the

record to find some circumstantial evidence to support 
your view of inferences and conclusions about 
reasonableness.  I think that partly makes the case and 
especially with a statute where deference is so owed. 

The gender claim is ambiguous, but it was not 

a challenge based solely on race and the circuits are 
split on the mixed motive question, as Justice Stevens 
indicated.  Second, Third, Fourth, Eighth, and 
Eleventh, and in one opinion in the Ninth, theyve 
addressed mixed motives generally saying your clearly 
established Federal law says that it has to be solely 
based on race.  Thats the current test in the 
standard. 

We raised Jackson and -- Jackson v. Virginia 

just because of the Lockyer v. Andrade case in which 
the Court indicates that clear error, when we talk 
about objective reasonableness in understanding (d)(2) 
and (d)(1) in the case of Andrade, that its more than 
clear error.  So were trying to figure out, well, 
whats more than clear error.  We dont know what it 
might be other than seeing the evidence in the light 
most favorable to the trier of fact. 

And finally, with respect to youth, clearly 
its reasonable for a judge to look at the demeanor of 
the DA whos saying again and again and again its a

young person, unmarried, no ties in the community.  One 
of the things we didnt talk about is the DA whos from 
Los Angeles knows that that juror lives in Inglewood. 
Now, there are different kind of neighborhoods in 
Inglewood, but a lot of them are neighborhoods with 
lots of drug dealing, and he might think or she might 
think, in this instance, it shows naivete to answer the 
question that theres never drug dealing in my 
neighborhood. 

Well, for all those concerns, theyre not 
implausible, theyre not fantastic, as you know from 
the decisions that the reasons can be superstitious. 
They can be silly. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But, youre coming up 

with still more reasons than the prosecutor came up 
with. 

MR. LOCKYER:  Well, theyre just the ones in 
the record, Your Honor.  So I wanted to make sure the 
Court was aware of them. 

But thats basically our contention, that 

deference was owed and the Ninth Circuit didnt respect 
that deference to trial judge that we rely on for 
credibility determinations. 

If there are no questions, thank you very 

much.
